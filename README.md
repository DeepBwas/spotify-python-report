# Spotify Python Report
All credit goes to the team as this is a group project with my friends in my second semester for Document Automation with Python course. The developers of this project are Alex, Kevin, Rodrigo and Deep Biswas. It was created over one week and all the developers worked as a team collabrating virtually or in person. 
## How to Run
Download the .py file and the .xlsx file. Put/keep them in same directory and run the .py file. You will see a menu in the terminal which can be used to generate various reports for the spotify songs data (excelsheet). 
Feel free to reach out with any questions or enquiry.
